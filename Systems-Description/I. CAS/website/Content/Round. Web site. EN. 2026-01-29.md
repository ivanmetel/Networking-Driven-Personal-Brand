A practical 4-week program that helps you prepare for meetings faster, understand the other side better, and increase your chances of a positive outcome

Using LinkedIn, Claude-like AI's and tailored automated workflows

# Why this exists
Complex systems start with a model and aren't built alone. We provide a meeting modeling tool — so you can define the system you want to create and negotiate its creation.

- Interviews
- Negotiations 
- Pitchs

What usually is prepared
- answers
- slides
- resumes
- scripts
    
What get you results
- how the other person thinks
- what they care about
- how decisions are actually made

_All models are wrong, but some are useful._ _George E. P. Box_

In communications, there is no ideal phrasing that will lead to success. Just as there is no ideal model. 
System modeling allows you to hold the integrity of what is happening in your attention and compare it with yours and the other side preferences.
A model provides a basis for explanations. Having mastered the rules of modeling, you stop improvising blindly. A sense of control emerges — and along with it, calmness.
No matter what happens.
# 4-Week Meeting Engineering Pipeline
Each week builds a specific layer of your personal meeting system
(недели одна за одной)

**Week 1. Modeling Principles**
- A clear method to model the "Big Picture" of your next meeting

**Week 2. Counterparty Modeling**

- Frameworks for modeling concerns and decision-making logic
- Ability to frame interlocutors' context and boundaries
- Clear criteria for discovering (or rejecting) fit between positions

**Week 3. Self Modeling**
- A framework to choose what part of you is relevant to their context (not just "who you are")
- A structure for a "30-second read" of your value proposition
- Alignment of online signals with the specific role you want to play
- Clear distinction between your general identity and the solution you provide here

**Week 4. Model Updating**
- A mechanism to update your model based on actual meeting outcomes

# CooperActive Systems
On meetings, interested parties compare their concerns regarding the future state of projects they are involved in and for which they are responsible.
We consider a meeting not as a beginning, but as an ongoing process. Taking in account passed meetings helps us to model future meetings.
This program get you ready for your next meeting.

Мы даем метод, вы выбираете, какую систему строить.

# FAQ
- What problem does this actually solve?
Reduce pre-meeting uncertainty to a manageable model.

- What will change in my next meeting?
Preparation will become shorter, and the conversation more predictable.

- Is this about persuasion or scripts?
No. It's about understanding the situation and the logic of decisions.

- Do I need technical or AI background?
No. All tools are used as work surfaces.

- Will this work for my context (interviews/sales/pitches)?
Yes, because the method is domain-specific, not decision-making-specific.

- What should I keep after the program?
A personal system for preparing and updating meeting models.
