# Problem <!-- Технический текст -->
//Audience pain points
Negotiations are like sparring, everything happens very fast. In a changing context, we are not immune to the feeling of losing control and self-possession.

Due to the overload of our "internal operating system," we cannot stop even at a quite acceptable option, and we also do not know which outcome among their infinite multitude is preferable to us.

## Role: Applicant <!-- Технический текст -->
*Interview*
You did everything considered right:
- Rehearsed answers to typical questions
- Prepared a strong resume and portfolio
- Spoke confidently and to the point

*You answer the questions, but do not understand the logic of the conversation.
And later, the reason for rejection.*

You expected the employer to spot your potential themselves.

## Role: Sales person <!-- Технический текст -->
*Negotiation*
You were well prepared:
- The script had answers to all objections
- You knew competitors and their weak points
- You clearly described the product and conditions
- You conducted the dialogue correctly

*Left the meeting with the feeling that everything went fine, but the process didn't move*

You prepared for objections, but not for the logic of decision-making.

## Role: Founder <!-- Технический текст -->
*Pitch*

You were confident in the material:
- You know your product down to the pixel
- You believe your passion will outweigh their fears
- You prepared growth logic and metrics

*You tell the story, but it doesn't resonate. Even though their portfolio already contains relevant projects*

You prepared for the presentation, but not for future interaction.

# Our Solution <!-- Технический текст -->
*All models are wrong, but some are useful*  
*George E. P. Box*  
In communications, there is no ideal phrasing that will lead to success. Just as there is no ideal model. It is hard to accept this — the world would be simpler if there were a single correct solution for every situation.

The presence of **preliminary context** and a **multi-level situation model** reduces cognitive load. System modeling allows you to hold the integrity of what is happening in your attention and compare it with your preferences.

A model provides a basis for explanations. Having mastered the rules of modeling, you stop improvising blindly. A sense of control emerges — and along with it, calmness.
No matter what happens.

## Outcome <!-- Технический текст -->
Predictability is key
- Winning interviews
- Closed deals
- Funded pitches

**Round Pipeline**
4 weeks of system modeling for negotiations

Each week is a step toward readiness for your next round. You get concrete skills and artifacts that you use immediately

*Week 1. Modeling principles*
We prepare to enter your next meeting with a ready model of the situation. You see this meeting not as a stand-alone negotiation unit, but as an embedded part of a sequence.

What you get after Week 1
- Basics of systems-engineering modeling
- How to model your next meeting
- How to understand the interlocutor and their context
- Language of abstractions for negotiations
- Reduced cognitive load

*Week 2. Counter-party Modeling*
We build the foundation of prospective meetings, where the interlocutor's model, their context and concerns are well defined. You understand the possible fit and know right words.

What you get after Week 2
- How to understand the interlocutor's context
- How to model their concerns and decision-making logic
- How to see the fit between your position and their context
- How to find the right words and images that resonate

*Week 3. Self Modeling*
We develop your own set of frames to both directly and indirectly evince your skills and intentions. This expands the strategy, supplementing self-directed outbound efforts with inbound signals.

What you get after Week 3
- How to model your position in the meeting context
- How to prepare your position in their context
- How to see connections between your words and their concerns
- How to translate your ideas clearly and persuasively

✅ Model of your position
   You understand how your position fits into their context. You see not just "your position," but the whole system of connections between you and their context.

✅ Skill to prepare your position
   You know how to prepare your position in their context. You see which words and images resonate with their concerns.

✅ Easy translation of ideas
   Your position model gives you a foundation for explanations. You easily translate your ideas — words and images emerge naturally.

✅ Confidence in your words
   You know what you're saying because you rely on the model. You don't improvise blindly — you have a foundation for every word.

Week 3 Result:
You enter the meeting with a model of your position in their context. You easily translate your ideas — words and images emerge naturally. You're confident in your words because you rely on the model.

## CooperActive Systems
An important stage of any project is negotiation. Interview, sale, pitch — at these, interested parties compare their concerns regarding the future state of projects they are involved in and for which they are responsible.

The methodology around Round provides a sustainable ability to achieve goals through modeling future meetings, their continuous generation, fitting oneself into their context and the context of future systems discussed at these meetings.

In the program, we will learn to view negotiations not as a singular negotiation unit, but as an event, a stage, woven into a larger project. Depending on the time considered — into a project, a program, a life, beyond the boundary of a single human life. 

A meeting can be a beginning, or it can be a continuation. We call this a Round. And we will teach you to be ready for your next round.

# FAQ
//Answers to objections
- **Q: What is special about your approach?**
	- A: The program is based on a systems-engineering approach. We adapted it to a narrow class of tasks — preparation and conduct of negotiations, in which uncertainty for you is minimized.
- **Q: Is this a negotiation course?**
	- A: No. Unlike negotiation techniques, where attention is paid to form (how to speak), we work with content (what to speak).
- **Q: What will I get as a result of the program?**
	- A: You will get two explicit changes: the skill to create system descriptions on which decisions are based, and a prototype of an IT platform for strategy realization and negotiation preparation.
- **Q: Is LinkedIn activity mandatory for me?**
	- A: Social visibility is one of the conditions for entering negotiations, and LinkedIn is one possible tool. Using its example, we show how this activity affects negotiations.
- **Q: Upon completion of the program, will I be able to succeed in any negotiation?**
	- A: We do not give such guarantees, but together with you we will create a personal "opportunity generator," a tool that will help you achieve your goals both technically and mentally.
- **Q: How do I understand if this negotiation preparation format suits me?**
	- A: All methodological materials are available to you for free upon registration. You can draw a conclusion yourself or ask us your questions directly: ..@..
