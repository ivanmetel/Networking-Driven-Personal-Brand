# Problem <!-- Технический текст -->
//Audience pain points
Negotiations are like sparring, everything happens very fast. In a changing context, we are not immune to the feeling of losing control and self-possession.

Due to the overload of our "internal operating system," we cannot stop even at a quite acceptable option, and we also do not know which outcome among their infinite multitude is preferable to us.

## Role: Applicant <!-- Технический текст -->
*Interview*
You did everything considered right:
- Rehearsed answers to typical questions
- Prepared a strong resume and portfolio
- Spoke confidently and to the point

*You answer the questions, but do not understand the logic of the conversation.
And later, the reason for rejection.*

You expected the employer to spot your potential themselves.

## Role: Sales person <!-- Технический текст -->
*Negotiation*
You were well prepared:
- The script had answers to all objections
- You knew competitors and their weak points
- You clearly described the product and conditions
- You conducted the dialogue correctly

*Left the meeting with the feeling that everything went fine, but the process didn't move*

You prepared for objections, but not for the logic of decision-making.

## Role: Founder <!-- Технический текст -->
*Pitch*

You were confident in the material:
- You know your product down to the pixel
- You believe your passion will outweigh their fears
- You prepared growth logic and metrics

*You tell the story, but it doesn't resonate. Even though their portfolio already contains relevant projects*

You prepared for the presentation, but not for future interaction.

# Our Solution <!-- Технический текст -->
*All models are wrong, but some are useful*  
*George E. P. Box*  
In communications, there is no ideal phrasing that will lead to success. Just as there is no ideal model. It is hard to accept this — the world would be simpler if there were a single correct solution for every situation.

The presence of **preliminary context** and a **multi-level situation model** reduces cognitive load. System modeling allows you to hold the integrity of what is happening in your attention and compare it with your preferences.

A model provides a basis for explanations. Having mastered the rules of modeling, you stop improvising blindly. A sense of control emerges — and along with it, calmness.
No matter what happens.

## Outcome <!-- Технический текст -->
Predictability is key
- Winning interviews
- Closed deals
- Funded pitches

**Round-Ready Pipeline**
4 weeks of systems modeling for negotiations

Each week moves you closer to *round readiness*.
You gain concrete skills and produce project delivarables you start using immediately.

*Week 1. Modeling Principles*
//Infographic — "ABC" — как основы
We prepare you to enter your next meeting with a ready model of the situation. You stop treating the meeting as a standalone negotiation and start seeing it as part of a broader sequence.

What you get after Week 1
- Foundations of systems-engineering modeling
- A clear method for modeling your next meeting
- Tools to understand the interlocutor and their context
- A shared language of abstractions for negotiations
- Reduced cognitive load during preparation

*Week 2. Counter-party Modeling*
//Infographic — Что-нибудь с конструктом
We build the foundation for prospective meetings by modeling the interlocutor: their context, constraints, concerns, and decision logic. You stop guessing intentions — and start reasoning about fit.

What you get after Week 2
- Applied systems-engineering concepts for real environments
- Ability to frame interlocutors' context and boundaries
- Frameworks for modeling concerns and decision-making logic
- Clear criteria for discovering (or rejecting) fit between positions

*Week 3. Self Modeling*
//Infographic — Оставляем человечка
We develop a structured representation of your position — one that can be expressed directly in conversation and indirectly through signals. This expands your strategy beyond outbound efforts and enables inbound traction.

What you get after Week 3
- Frameworks for modeling your preferences and constraints
- A structured foundation for your professional presence
- An adjustable, medium-agnostic self-description
- Practical ways to bridge the gap between you and the interlocutor

*Week 4. Model Updating*
//Infographic — Оставляем цикл
You assemble your personal opportunity generator — the *Round Platform*. A working system that supports preparation, execution, and learning across rounds. You enter meetings with a model — and leave with clarity, not unanswered questions.

What you get after Week 4:
- Project and opportunity prioritization policies
- A meetings-generation pipeline
- A project deliverables development pipeline
- AI-agents orchestration principles
- An operational Round Platform, ready for use

## Methodology <!-- Технический текст -->
Words matter, yet they don't. Concepts close the deal. Systems modeling is the language of abstractions helping to overcome barriers.

# Provider
//About the company
## CooperActive Systems
An important stage of any project is negotiation. Interview, sale, pitch — at these, interested parties compare their concerns regarding the future state of projects they are involved in and for which they are responsible.

The methodology around Round provides a sustainable ability to achieve goals through modeling future meetings, their continuous generation, fitting oneself into their context and the context of future systems discussed at these meetings.

In the program, we will learn to view negotiations not as a singular negotiation unit, but as an event, a stage, woven into a larger project. Depending on the time considered — into a project, a program, a life, beyond the boundary of a single human life. 

A meeting can be a beginning, or it can be a continuation. We call this a Round. And we will teach you to be ready for your next round.

# FAQ
//Answers to objections
- **Q: What is special about your approach?**
	- A: The program is based on a systems-engineering approach. We adapted it to a narrow class of tasks — preparation and conduct of negotiations, in which uncertainty for you is minimized.
- **Q: Is this a negotiation course?**
	- A: No. Unlike negotiation techniques, where attention is paid to form (how to speak), we work with content (what to speak).
- **Q: What will I get as a result of the program?**
	- A: You will get two explicit changes: the skill to create system descriptions on which decisions are based, and a prototype of an IT platform for strategy realization and negotiation preparation.
- **Q: Is LinkedIn activity mandatory for me?**
	- A: Social visibility is one of the conditions for entering negotiations, and LinkedIn is one possible tool. Using its example, we show how this activity affects negotiations.
- **Q: Upon completion of the program, will I be able to succeed in any negotiation?**
	- A: We do not give such guarantees, but together with you we will create a personal "opportunity generator," a tool that will help you achieve your goals both technically and mentally.
- **Q: How do I understand if this negotiation preparation format suits me?**
	- A: All methodological materials are available to you for free upon registration. You can draw a conclusion yourself or ask us your questions directly: ..@..
